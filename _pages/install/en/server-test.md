## Client

After client installation, which can also be obtained through Admin, the standard service URL needs to be entered during the client installation process in the following form.

    http://serverurl:port/Service/OneOffixxService.svc
   
The installation was successful if the client is able to log in to service and able to synchronize data.

## Web

It is now possible to open the web application if it was installed previously.

The respective users should be displayed in the ‘Security’ tab under Data source Management in the Admin Dashboard after the site has loaded.
